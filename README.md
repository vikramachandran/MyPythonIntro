# MyPythonIntro - Created Aug 24th 2017
This repo is intended to upload all the Python exercises coding that I did as part of Udacity Introduction to Python Programming course.
All these exercises reflect concrete understanding of the python programming constructs and data structures.
Tools used - Anaconda Jupyter Notebook for developing the code and unit testing.
